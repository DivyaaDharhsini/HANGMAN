# HANGMAN
Built a classic Hangman game using Python!
This mini project helped me strengthen my skills in:
📌 Loops and conditionals
📌 List manipulation
📌 String formatting
📌 Basic game logic and user interaction


Features include:
🎮 6 total guesses with letter tracking
📜 Optional rules display for new players
🔁 Option to replay after each round

I'm still learning, but this project shows how even simple ideas can be fun and teach you a lot!
Would love to hear your feedback — or ideas to improve it further!
